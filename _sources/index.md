## How the course works

This course is focussed on producing an independent project report and presentation that ties together concepts and techniques you've learned in other courses.  The final product is a written report plus code and data.  Typically the report is 15-25 pages long with 10-15 figures and has to include your own work (i.e. not just a literature review).
